Full stack project for a cryptocurrency, named "Rewards" and it's ICO. The programming languages that I used were Solidity for the backend and vanilla JavaScript for the frontend and for the tests. I used HTML5 for the structure and the CSS framework Bootstrap 3 for the styles. It's supposed to run on the Ethereum blockchain, which means you can pay ETH to receive RWD tokens.

The projects purpose was to train my skills, as a blockchain developer, when I used to work for Quanterall in 2021
